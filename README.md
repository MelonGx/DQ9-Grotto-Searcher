# DQ9 Grotto Searcher
A powerful Grotto search tool created by using Claude and Gemini.

Based on reverse-engineered database, dq9tmap101.exe's ElistOfs logic, and some edge cases fixed by TKG and Claude.

Improvements from legacy DQ9 Grotto search tools
- Fixed misjudgments (such as misjudging Single Monster Floor into No-enemy Floor, etc.) by fixing ElistOfs logic by TKG
- Fundamentally fixed Softlock (危険？ハマる地図 in Japanese, floor Seed 0x5BC7)'s wrong display of stairs & chests by referring Yab's DQ9 Tool's result then fixing reverse-engineered database by Claude
- Deciphered Multibug phenomenon and implemented Multibug special floor searching by Claude and Gemini

For details, please see Disclaimer inside the tool.
